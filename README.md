# LibJ

A C library I am writing, mostly for personal use. I plan on writing implementations of most common data structures and their associated algorithms. Eventually the scope of things may increase and I'll feel compelled to add additional things as well.

All APIs are defined in `libj.h`, and the makefile is set up to compile the code into a `.so` already. I'm also hoping to maintain a test suite, which you can check out, compile, and run for yourself via the makefile as well.
